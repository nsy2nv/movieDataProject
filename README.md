# movieDataProject
BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY

We are entertained, educated, or become aware of critical social issues when we see movies. 
We learn about a new culture, experience a different perspective, or open our eyes to a world we know nothing about.
Movies also change culture by influencing the beliefs, opinions, and behaviors of the people who see them. 
For example, a documentary about child abuse may move you to take action against child abuse in your community, 
whether by volunteering for an organization or donating money. Movies also promote economic growth by creating jobs 
for thousands of people from all walks of life and generating billions of dollars in revenue each year. In this project, we 
seek to investigate the following using the revenue dataset. 

RESEARCH QUESTIONS

•	Is there a correlation between the total gross revenue and the number of releases for a movie?

•   What is the highest total grossing movie for the dataset?

•	Is there a correlation between the first release gross and the total gross?

•	Identify the top-grossing movies in the dataset and analyze common characteristics or factors contributing to their success
